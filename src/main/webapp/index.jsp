        <h3>WHY IS A STUDENTS HEALTH IMPORTANT?</h3>
        <div id="explain">
        <p>Student health is vital because it
            impacts learning, focus, and overall 
            academic performance. 
            When students are physically and mentally well, 
            they're more likely to attend class, 
            stay engaged, and succeed in their studies.
